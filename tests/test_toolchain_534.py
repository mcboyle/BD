"""test_toolchain_534.py -- RED-first guards for the v3.66.534 toolchain additions:
  B  capture.sh runs the graph content-hash gate (P2) when a graph db is present
  E  bd-scan.py has a TS/TSX-aware scan path (semgrep-backed) for frontend/src

run_tests.py harness conventions: zero-arg test_* functions, plain asserts, no
pytest builtins, layout-flexible file discovery. Stdlib only.

RED-first map (fail on pristine 533 -> pass after 534):
  B test_capture_sh_has_graph_checkhash_gate  -> capture.sh had no graph --check-hash
       step. RED: the P2 pin is toothless on stash.
  B test_capture_sh_graph_gate_is_conditional -> the gate must be guarded by a
       db-present check (graceful skip when the db isn't deployed). RED: no gate.
  E test_bd_scan_has_ts_scan_path             -> bd-scan.py had no TS/TSX scan
       (graph is grep-level for frontend). RED: no --ts / scan_ts.
  E test_bd_scan_ts_uses_semgrep             -> the TS path must invoke semgrep
       (the uploaded kit) rather than re-grep. RED: no semgrep reference.
